|   B    |             accept             | Yes.       |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | they just watch them and let them play and things like that, take a long time to find the right place |

|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Not, it depends on the state you live actually. Some laws absolutely prohibit it. Some states, say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that. Our state doesn't yet, say that I'm not a certified teacher. I went to college, levels right now |
|   B    |           summarize            | they haven't been to public schools at all. |

------------------------------------
|   A    |        yes-no-question         | does the company you work for test for drugs? |
|   B    |         open-question          | they just recently started a policy of testing drugs, which was kind of interesting, when I went to work for them, they didn't do that, since then  requests that we do that. How about you? |
|   A    | statement expanding y/n answer | no, we're not being tested for drugs at all, |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | our policies and procedures manual, the furthest it goes about drugs is in kind of the miscellaneous section, or it's reasons for immediate dismissal, it says, use of narcotics on company premises. that's pretty general, |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Okay.      |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | I work for an environmental management firm I'm an engineer there, I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites, I don't operate any machinery. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Yeah. Uh-huh. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a medical monitoring program, they're at a higher risk of exposure blood screening is part of that I think that drugs, they do test for drugs in that capacity, it's not their exclusive, it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   A    |          wh-question           | I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field. What is the nature of your company's business? |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | it's actually, we do oil well services. a lot of our clients are big oil companies, they go out to, we have engineers who, go out and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff, the clients are very concerned that, the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy, because they're on their, territory and everything, the thing that's interesting is that  a software engineer I work in the software, house, everybody there, are all software engineers. the oil rigs or anything, yet, to, a little different, actually, we have to go through the same thing, than a lot of drug policies. In our case, it's like, when you hire on, they'll test you, then if you get injured on the job, if you trip and fall or something, they give you a drug test right away. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | really?    |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that, a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first. Particularly, we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol, they didn't find any problem with that, |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Right. an issue, in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening.  In fact , they'll have these little parties, people will just get, I've, my brother lives where I work, I have many a time called him to come get me, they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Yeah       |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | I think drug testing, I don't know, I think it's got some relevance, I think its relevance is pretty limited. I think, in your case, I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, it's really bizarre. particularly, where we are, I, there was a story of a woman last year and sprained her ankle she was a personnel secretary she had to get tested I don't know I'm ambivalent about the whole thing. I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand, it's like if, they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | it's like  where I had to, do a drug test it was kind of a long story, it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through, it amounted to, going in, before any of these interviews, I'm not even working for this company, I'm going in for, interviews they flew me out to Chicago before I went into any of the interviews, they took me to the doctor to give me a physical. They said it was going to be a physical, beforehand they told me they were going to, do drug screening, I had forgotten about that, basically, I'd already peed off  in  that morning I wasn't, able to give a full sample, |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Oh. Right. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes, drink a whole ton of water before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again, the  procedure is utterly humiliating. You go in there with the doctor, he makes you take off all your clothes he examines you. |
------------------------------------
|   A    |        yes-no-question         | the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a, long term financial plan and monthly budget. The only thing I do now is, put the data into Quicken. I don't know if you are familiar with that. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah, I have some friends of mine who use Quicken I've considered using it once myself, I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | I kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken, at least for now. Uh-huh. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | I've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then, not bother to total it it comes in to doing all the arithmetic. it really helps with that. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah, it's similar problems we just have the one check book we try to keep it up to date as much as possible occasionally we will get behind like you say it doesn't really seem to be up to date and balanced. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |         open-question          | how to you handle that, the long range or medium range planning on finances? |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | we haven't had to. until just recently. I guess we've got a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | we needed to start doing more of that just for, saving for college and things like that. We try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah. that's pretty good if you can do that. I know. I have a daughter who's ten we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college, we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall the money that I will be making this summer we'll be putting away for the college fund. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Sounds good. Yeah, I guess we're just at the point, my wife worked until we had a family now we're just going on the one income |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | it's a lot more interesting trying to, find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to, do it. kind of enforce the savings. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | it will be interesting to see   . |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | our situation is just kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently, took on a full time job, almost full time. it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for, long range goals like college and sickness and travel and that kind of thing. |
|   A    |          wh-question           | That sounds good. I was just curious, what, part of the country. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Stockton.  |
|   A    |       acknowledge-answer       | okay.      |
|   B    |         open-question          | How about you? |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Cincinnati, actually. I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with, the western accents or something like that. I don't know how many people are, getting involved in this |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |           or-clause            | that's interesting. I was kind of interested if you found out about the study by, reading TELECOM DIGEST was there another? |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | a colleague of mine at, work got some information over, the computer network called INTERNET. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | okay. Yeah, that is how I got it as well |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | he just forwarded that on to me |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | it sounded like it would be an interesting project to participate in |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah,      |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | I sent back    mail. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | It would be interesting to see how the data base,    I guess we're talking about the experiment. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | probably need to try to get back on the topic |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |             offer              | it's hard to talk about finances without getting to, dollar figures I guess we could talk about some of the long range goals |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | what other long range goals do you have besides college? Uh-huh. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | I think, either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that. It seems like every year my employer just gives back, a little bit your tuition reimbursement. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | they use to reimburse one hundred percent now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class it's a real shame from what we had before, because we're, |
------------------------------------
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Right, I lived over in Europe for a couple of years, I lived in Germany in Germany they don't have the jury system. What they do is they have, three judges, basically. you get up there the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence your defense attorney presents their evidence those three guys take the evidence, go off, figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | our judicial system is in such total chaos. I think what they need to do is, they need to somehow take the money out of it. when you have a man that's signed a statement saying he's guilty, we have a family called All day family. They were all murdered. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | All the people signed confessions, they went to a trial by jury. They been trying these people now for twenty-two years, ever since I was a child. |
|   A    |          appreciation          | Wow.       |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done, has nothing to do with justice whatsoever. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | it's one of those things, I would have to look at it. just the judges, the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day, they know all the procedures, they know what's good and what isn't, they'd be able to say, I'm sorry, you can't use this as, evidence, because it was either illegally obtained or whatever you wouldn't have this, theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the jury the judge says, no, disregard that. Come on, any jury's not going to disregard the evidence, |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | that's true. I think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | That may very well be. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | I hold it in the utmost contempt. my favorite is the police department, they're not aimed at the criminal. The judicial system is aimed at the citizens you and I, we have work schedules, we can be called at work, we have Social Security numbers, they can trace us down, we have telephones, then we have checkbooks. Criminals have none of these things. They're real difficult to catch, if they do catch them, they don't get any monetary gain out of it, whereas we write a check. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   B    |      rhetorical question       | where do you think they target their efforts? |
|   A    |           abandoned            | That's true.  You d- , |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | They target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals. |
|   A    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | How would you go about changing it? |
|   B    |           abandoned            | that's a, I've nailed the problem down I, |
|   A    |           completion           | Leave the details up to somebody else, |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah, I'm going to have to leave those details like, what would you do about, I think, to begin with, you would have, here in Atlanta area, our crime rate is just astronomical, you go out on the streets they're giving speeding tickets. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |

|   A    |           abandoned            | talking about the lawyers, what might very well a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that, is to set the fees for cases. It's kind of like like, V C R or television repair. If you take your T V in, a lot of these T V repair places will say, I'll repair your T V for a hundred dollars, if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it, then he eats it. he repairs it, gives it back to you, and takes your hundred dollars. if he comes in and says, I'll repair your V C R, or somebody else's V C R, for a hundred dollars, gets in there, maybe it's a blown fuse, takes him two minutes, he fixes it, he still charges you that hundred dollars. maybe if we did that with the lawyers, so that, whether it's a murder case or somebody suing somebody else, you get X dollars for that case that's it. None of this, |
|   B    |        yes-no-question         | I firmly believe in that when you get the most heinous of crimes, have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney? |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | yeah. Yeah. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | here's this bum that didn't have a job he's got a attorney that you and I could never afford. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | That's true. Yeah. |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | Who's paying for that? |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | you're talking to part of them that's paying for that |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, you're talking to the other half that's paying for it |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | That's right. it's amazing they're all former lawyers. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, that's another problem. I think to really correct the judicial system, you have to get the lawyers out of it they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever, with that type person running it, you could expect that you, |

|   A    |          or-question           | Do you know anyone that, is in a nursing home or has ever been in one? |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | No. my grandparents were looking into it before I know what they've said. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | I'm trying to think. My, wife's grandmother had Alzheimer's they were going to put her into a nursing home when they put her in, she had all kinds of trouble the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a nuisance.  Or worse than a nuisance, |
|   B    |           summarize            | they thought it was too much of a bother. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | she sort of went, bananas they couldn't deal with her I guess you need to, know whether it's a no deposit, no return kind of thing whether |
|   B    |             accept             | Right.     |
|   A    |             accept             | Yeah.      |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | If they're equipped to handle the kind of patients you're going to have put in there too. I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her they wanted to be independent as well. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | Have their own room. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | My grandmother actually was in a nursing home that, there was a retirement hotel and then a, there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it for, the first few years she had her own apartment and, made her own meals sometimes. But could also go and eat someplace else. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | as she became less able to take care of herself, then she moved into this other part that was able to, provide full-time care she didn't have to do anything anymore. my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly. that's som-, I don't know whether that's because they, sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the reason is. I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only six months or something. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | They need health care they're already ill before they go. |

|   B    |       statement-opinion        | That's probably a  large factor. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah. if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you, then you stay where you are. Then you only go there as a last resort. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | people send you there as a last resort. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Right, right. That's what my grandparents, it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened, there was somebody there for them. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | that was their thinking. Somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | So they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time. I guess that's a problem too for people. Wait lists and all. |
|   A    |             hedge              | Yeah,  I guess. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | That,  you can't always get in when you want too of course, you can't just sit around and wait. |

|   A    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | At that stage of life you only have so much money left I guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | it is kind of fair, it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise. |

|   A    |       statement-opinion        | if it were you, you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Right, right. it's just so complicated anymore, I think People outlive their savings. with medicine being the way it is, you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah. maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | It's just a shame that's the way it has to be. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | I think  the retirement home idea's a nice idea. To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay cause if your spouse died,    all alone, it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |

------------------------------------
|   A    |        yes-no-question         | have you ever served on a jury? |
|   B    |        yes-no-question         | No, I've not. I've been called, I had to beg off from the duty. you? |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | I was called I was not chosen. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | I was, originally chosen primarily, I think, because I was a young fellow they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict. I don't know why. Something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | really?    |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, it's that the younger they are, they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason, they kind of liked me. I looked conser-, and all that stuff they, I don't know what they saw in me, they saw it. back to the issue, I don't know, at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted, especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun. there, too, there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable, particularly, I think in civil cases. In criminal cases, I'd like to see the unanimity remain, in civil cases, I think a majority rule by jury would be sufficient. |
|   A    |         open-question          | could you give me an example of a case where you think that? |
|   B    |             hedge              | in a criminal case, say one in which, there is, say assault or some such. I think there ought to be a unanimous, vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this. in civil law there, is such a thing as let's say, misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that. A majority rule, I think, would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases. I don't know if I'm making any sense or not. |
|   A    |        yes-no-question         | I think, are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more, tangible |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, often there's more incriminating evidence. for instance, say, also, too, I think I'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more, serious in a criminal case. |
|   A    |        yes-no-question         | do you think that in a civil case, if there was majority rule, that it would be easy for someone to be set up? |
|   B    |        yes-no-question         | I really can't say for certain, truth be known. as it stands, civil and criminal case. the, documentary, the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that. I don't know if you're familiar with that or not. |
|   A    | statement expanding y/n answer | No, I'm not. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | A, fellow when he was much younger, was tried and convicted and sentenced to death. Fortunately, in his case, the death penalty was revoked his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system. The case was reopened he was exonerated. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, many laws, but little justice. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Say, I also think, just like you were talking about before, why you were chosen to be on a jury that, the process of picking jurors is not always objective. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | certainly not, certainly not. they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this, they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires. the, you get up they ask you a few questions, both sides do, you're either challenged which is, each attorney can use that as much as they like I think it's a limit now, they probably have a limit now, they pretty much go through that, you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve. For me, it was financial hardship, onto the thing, I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing. It was always my impression that the Justice himself, or herself, had the final say. |

|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | the other one are the Saturns. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | those two things. we kind of want a four door. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Okay       |
------------------------------------
|   A    |          wh-question           | Okay. What is your, community, currently doing with regard to recycling? |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | basically, they're just, having various recycling, bins, located for, trash pickup. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Uh-huh that's more than we have up here in Massachusetts. in that respect they do have bins set up. I live in a metropolitan area they're not, too inclined to do something as aggressive as that |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | here they live in an apartment complex. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | they only have one set of recycling bins, one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters. a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because, it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | to do something like that because it does take extra effort. Whether I know Massachusetts has, a bottle bill was passed we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now, the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably, believe it or not, is just to get the extra nickel at the store and not, that's the majority of people that I know of anyways. Where people aren't really, eco conscious. It's just the fact that it's something they have to do. I'm not going to throw a bottle away, it's like throwing a nickel away. That type of thing. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | people need to be more conscious of it. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | here they're trying to push through a bill a lot of people are against it. it's going to create a lot more work for the stores that sell, sodas and stuff. they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah    it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans. for it to go through. it's been pretty successful people notice it as far as, highways being, people would have a drink of soda, instead of throwing out the window, they keep the bottle as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth. more importantly, it's recycling reusable materials back into, manufacturing. that's the big thing, I think, that they try to promote. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah, I think here put out the trash and stuff, if they could get some kind of rebate, those people who do put the stuff out, and separate it, have lower collection fee or something  may  that's a good idea.  Yeah. |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | encourage people to separate. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | there definitely has to be a motivation factor I know that, where I work, I work for a defense contractor. there's a big push on for recycling, paper materials, computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of, Styrofoam usage because of and the whole eco issue and that. they're very proactive matter of fact, they give you discounts if you use, china wear rather than, Styrofoam stuff, people more conscious of it. I think that's what they need to do. Be more  proactive  like that. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books. usually have them come from    projects to collect old ones. Usually just get dumped out with the trash. phone books are a large volume of annual trash. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah. they just, matter of fact, that reminded me of an article I saw in the pa-, the local schools, you could send your phone book with your kid to school what they'll do is they'll recycle it. there was an article or a story done awhile ago that, the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time. A guy went to and pulled up a phone book from nineteen sixty they don't degrade over such a period of time. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | They contain the glue and stuff they used to have to take out all the, pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Now I think they've come up with some way of, pulling the glue out. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah. Okay |
------------------------------------

|   B    |       statement-opinion        | they ate dinner at the table together. the parents usually took out more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | although I'm not a mother, I still think that, a lot has changed since ten years ago. |

|   A    |       statement-opinion        | I do agree that, generally society has sort of, let's see, rushed everything ahead. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | I don't know, it leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that. In other words, they just prioritize their lives differently. I think that has a lot to do with economic situation. |
|   B    |         open-question          | Yes. What about as far as, social changes in the individual? |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | Do  you think that the individual has as much time as they did, let's say, ten, twenty years ago? |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | It depends. it's hard to say because I think people were busy ten twenty years ago too. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |           abandoned            | I just     |

|   A    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | And that, usually as far as families are concerned, there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | now, it's pretty much an economic necessity in most places for both parents to work. |
|   B    |           or-clause            | Do you think it's an economic necessity do you think that we're, all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living? |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | I think that's part of it too. I do think, |

|   A    |       statement-opinion        | I tend to think that it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | you think it's, which group are you saying  is the one trying?  Uh-huh. |

|   A    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing, middle class in this country I think that that's, in my opinion, the case. |

|   B    |       statement-opinion        | I say they, probably the best things to do is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water |

|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Uh-huh. You'd have to say that. I don't know. whether the judge should be the one that does the, sentencing. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | seems to me that I think that's the way it's done now. at least, my understanding of the law which isn't very good. |

|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Probably  more tuned in to that. Possibly though on, capital cases like maybe the death penalty |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole, he could have a personal prejudice. |

|   B    |           abandoned            | judges are people like  everybody else  even though they're supposed to be impartial  maybe, |
|   A    |        yes-no-question         | I  think that may be an exception as well. I think that, doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than  the judge? |

|   B    |       statement-opinion        | something like that, I've got no problem with it.   I guess the way I think about it  it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | It's just like if you've got a dog that's running wild and biting people put it to sleep, Just get it out, it's not able to fit in, |

|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah. Yeah, exactly I guess, kind of the way I think about it also, is they just, if somebody gets the death penalty, they're judged guilty, they got the death penalty, they should have one year and one appeal. Cover all their bases with one appeal if not, don't let them sit up there on death row for, fifteen years. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah. I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years. |
|   B    |           abandoned            | Uh-huh.  Yeah, that, |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | I guess  there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake |

|   A    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | Which, again, I think is the way it is now. That all verdicts, maybe not. I don't know. At least in capital cases I'd think they'd have to be  unanimous. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | I believe  it is  in capital. I think in lesser cases it's ten out of twelve or five out of six, whatever |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | How ever many is sitting on a jury. I believe that's the way it is. I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah. The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |

|   A    |       statement-opinion        | I think that, one, advantage of having, the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't, convict someone who, really shouldn't be convicted. |
|   B    |             accept             | Definitely. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | I think that, a unanimous verdict, helps to ensure that. I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way, that, you, would have a problem, that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |

|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | They were just, small time cases where, trailers and banks were involved, |
|   A    |          or-question           | were they criminal or civil? |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | They were civil. |
|   A    |       acknowledge-answer       | okay.      |

|   A    |          acknowledge           | what was the verdict? did the jury have trouble reaching a decision? Yeah. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | the jury, I think it was ten to one on the jury, because they only had to have eleven people it was, they, the one changed his vote at the end. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | did it become? Yeah. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | it became unanimous, after they turned it in he changed his mind after they turned it in it then became unanimous. |
|   A    |        yes-no-question         | since it was a civil case it really didn't matter, You just needed a majority? |
|   B    |             accept             | Right.     |

|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | I haven't been, a jury eligible age for very long I did get one summons actually at one point, I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student, because it was, a very bad time. |

|   A    |           abandoned            | Yeah, to do at some point, I haven't. I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now, I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well.  Especially sort of.  wha-, |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | I wouldn't think  that it does from what I experienced in them, it didn't turn out the way I planned it, the way that I would think that it would go. |
|   A    |        yes-no-question         | you thought it turned out pretty well? |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah, it was, jury was unorganized just wasn't  organized enough for me. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | I'm not used to it not being organized, I just assumed that it would have been. |
|   A    |        yes-no-question         | it was just kind of a zoo the jurors just sort of, someone had to figure out what was going on? |
|   B    |             accept             | That's about what it was. |
|   A    |        yes-no-question         | That's interesting. did it work out pretty well in the end? did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of assume, sort of a moderator role in the trial |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah, they picked one person, he finally, moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have. |
|   A    |        yes-no-question         | it did end up working out pretty well? |
|   B    | statement expanding y/n answer | Yeah, it ended up working all right. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | The one thing I sometimes wonder about, in civil cases is, whether, especially sort of in, maybe product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Yes.       |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | it's not just a matter of, did this guy rip off this guy, it's just a matter of interpreting a contract, it's sort of a matter of, sometimes getting into very technical issues, I wonder in educating the jurors about, whatever, issue is under discussion. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | to really know what's going on. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | in the case you were involved in, you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind. |

------------------------------------
|   A    |         open-question          | I get most of my news from newspapers really. I read the daily newspaper, the HOUSTON CHRONICLE sometimes I'll read the, WALL STREET or the NEW YORK TIMES. I don't subscribe to either, sometimes I get a hold of copies of it. how about you? |

|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | it's similar to that, it's DOW JONES, which is, the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire. |
|   A    |        yes-no-question         | okay. that's interesting. Okay. Yeah, I had access in the past to, the A P news wire I thought a pretty good way to get news. I've never used the DOW JONES news wire yeah it, do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of a broader, more long term analytical sort of approach? |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | actually not. I do, follow, I don't know how to describe it I'll say a religious newspaper which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense. |

|   B    |       statement-opinion        | It's a weekly not like BUSINESS WEEK or NEWS WEEK or one of those kinds of things. I'd like to say however, that I'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires |
|   A    |          or-question           | In what way? quality or sort of an orientation in terms of view point or the way the news is presented or whatever? |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | I think that it has to do with, I personally think, I have a problem with their viewpoint |

|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah. Absolutely. after all, who writes. People who are journalist who are trained to write |

|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah. the other thing that I always notice is that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert in, I find their descriptions to be wrong Yeah. |

|   A    |       statement-opinion        | they generally make mistake on anything technical at least . |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | That's right. even if it's not technical. If it's, some social thing or whatever. It doesn't matter. If I am an expert in it, they usually make mistakes which makes me think I'm not expert in it. They're telling me lies. |
|   A    |           or-clause            | Yeah. Yeah. by mistakes, do you mean just like honest mistakes do you think they are deliberate sorts of things? |

|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | to give you an example, we will go out of the printing media. I know of cases where, we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but, with the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing they are showing you. Which is sort of like a deliberate bias. |
|   A    |          appreciation          | That's disturbing. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | which is rather disturbing.  he does that. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | I haven't  really noticed them doing that, whatever, again I don't watch T V news that much now. If I had access to C N N, I would watch T V news more. I don't usually. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, I don't have access either. Although, I did at one time it was, I did during the Gulf War it was addictive. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah. the Gulf War coverage would be kind of, an abnormality? I just wonde-, I guess. I would be curious to know what you thought as to how C N N T V news compared to the three networks. whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever I guess you wouldn't. You probably, if you just watched it during the Gulf War, that probably wouldn't tell you much. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, during that small sample, I would think that everyone was just about the same, except the three networks,    radio television programming. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah. Yeah. |

|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah, yeah, I'd heard that phrase. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Uh-huh, yeah, that's kind of the latest thing, every year in the D C area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides, it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here, I'm from Ohio my wife's from Florida |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | we've just come from twenty years in the military  which is an entirely different environment, this is a whole new thing to have to put up with it's, really scary sometimes. |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | Yeah, there aren't that many, places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |

I would hate to have to wrestle with that problem. I don't know what the solution is. there's no way they can stop the drugs, that's what's causing all the killing. . |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | there's a couple of things that I've heard, |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | most of them are fairly, radical in terms of what you'd have to do. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh. Uh-huh. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | course and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else the parents aren't making a living at anything. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Right they see all their friends and neighbors, |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | they're accidental parents half the time anyway. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, their friends are driving Mercedes it's actually, they grow up with that as their way of life I think, to a large extent, they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | It's illegal, it's not wrong because all their friends do it. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Right exactly, maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | it's the law that's, got to be changed instead of their way of life, I don't know, it's I'm glad it's not the kind of problem I have to come up with an answer to because it's not easy. Uh-huh. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms wouldn't go away. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Right. They've always been with us. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | there's been a lot of, I used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus, |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | then, the more I thought about it, the more sense it made, is that, alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh. Right. |

------------------------------------
|   A    |         open-question          | Okay, looks like we're ready to go. Capital punishment, the problem I have with capital punishment is that, it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime, I don't think that it really actually does that. I don't think it deters anybody, because most of the time crimes without any thought to the consequences they don't stop and think and say, maybe I shouldn't do this, because, I might get the gas chamber or something like that. They worry about it afterwards they try and get out of it. how about you |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | I think that in some cases, it is warranted. |
|   A    |             accept             | Uh-huh, I do, too, yep. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | I don't, I think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh, yeah, you still have to do it. I, Uh-huh. |
|   B    |           abandoned            | I'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer |
|   A    |           summarize            | you're in favor of capital punishment, then. |
|   B    |          accept-part           | for some things. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | I think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood, |
|   A    |           completion           | Needs to be punished or, eliminated from society. Right. And then do it all over again. |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Right. Have to agree with you, I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, you still see them committing the same crimes, I tend to agree with you that, we should have it I don't know that it's always effective I guess we're kind of stuck with it. it's a difficult, problem, isn't it, to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime, |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | then, I think that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right, like, for example, you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them uh-huh. |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | I don't think, that would really warrant capital punishment. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh, Do you think they should be punished at all, or, go to prison, they're not really a danger to society. It was almost really self defense, isn't it, in a case like that. Uh-huh. |
|   B    |             hedge              | it is to a certain extent I think, I don't know because, |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | I know they put them in jail sometimes, I guess. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | I think in s-, it, |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Um. |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | just would depend upon the circumstances and if another alternative was available. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Uh-huh. I wonder what you think about this unfortunately, we don't get to do it, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. if somebody killed somebody in your family then you had the right to, execute that person. I know that, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them I don't think that's done much anywhere That's kind of drastic punishment. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | I think that would be kind of drastic punishment. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Right. Might make you feel better Uh-huh. |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | one thing, I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance should be investigated. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Right. Uh-huh. Right. Uh-huh. |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | like I said, is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then I think they should be eliminated from society. |
|   A    |             accept             | Right, because they're a danger to everybody else. that's interesting. I have to, agree with that. There's a lot of folks, probably, that are in prison that aren't really a danger to society, Right. |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | a lot of people that are a danger to society that aren't in prison. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Right, probably more of them then the other way around Interesting. not sure I'm in Washington, D C or at least very close to it. I'm not sure what kind of, capital punishment we have here. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | I know in North Carolina, we do have capital punishment. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | I'm from South Carolina. |

|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | we, in our family, have been pretty remiss in trying to, keep track of, daily finances. way back, what, twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer, I did what everybody else does, which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks, and, checkbooks and all this kind of thing we kept that going for about a month it became so onerous that we gave up on it |

|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | that's really about, the extent of the kind of, financial score keeping that we're doing. |

|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | I know how much I have to bring in a month that's about it. That's about as far as we go. anything extra is, more or less split up between all of us. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | And just thrown in the kitty, more or less, for a rainy day |

|   A    |          appreciation          | Oh dear.   |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | right now I know what I'm getting from the state I have to balance, more or less, what I get from the state with my bills and, try to work as many days as possible. |

My kids are in Boy Scouts trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts every penny I bring in is ten percent to me. it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit. we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul.

------------------------------------
|   A    |         open-question          | Okay, this topic is, is Russia a threat to our security? I think they are more of a threat to their own people at this day and time. how do you feel about it? |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | they do have, a major internal problem Everybody wants to defect, I can understand why. I think their biggest problem is just, obtaining food to live, when you have the basic needs, being unmet I don't think you think globally as far as, being a threat to other people in the world. as soon as they get their own home country taken care of, then they'll consider, what they can do with the rest of the world. |
|   A    |         open-question          | I believe Communism is very much waning It's, pretty much on the way out of the door, insofar as the strong hold that they used to have, the Russian people are all realizing that the Communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world, their rebellions right now is the result of that If they can get the army, or the military to sway to their side, I think that, it will be on the way out eventually. It's just a matter of time, because, in the Baltic States they have already massacred so many people who protested, that hasn't set too well with their diplomacy regarding the, outcome of their affairs What's your synopsis? |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | with how they're handling their internal, strife, as far as diplomacy is concerned I think it's been a good positive direction for the Soviets as far as Yeltsin is concerned. he was, allowed to, wh-, gives him more power overall, which I think is a good sign that there will be some, politically speaking, he's going to have more power, I think it's a step in the right direction. I think Gorbachev realizes that he's got a major power figure, competing against him, I think it's going to be pretty close to his demise if he doesn't follow suit with Yeltsin as far as, realizing, he does realize it, with the fact that food and goods. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Uh-huh. I think that it went up a thousand percent on most, |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | It, yeah. that's incredible they had to, go in the direction of a market driven economy, they had to bite the bullet for that. that's a good move on Gorbachev's part in doing that. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Uh-huh Gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that, he's moving towards a two to three party system of government  nor eliminating or diminishing the Communist power, I guess that's where Yeltsin steps in, so far as his politics of government goes, I don't know how convinced the people are of him yet, myself. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | that's all they got right now. That's their ray of hope. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | they'll go with whoever comes through for them. it's just that, the weird thing perestroika and stuff, I think he's got between the Old Guard , and the new, glasnost. I think it's kind of escalated to a point where it's out of control. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |        yes-no-question         | I think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how, in order to keep the peace on both sides. I think that's kind of where he's stuck. You know what I'm saying? |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah. I understand. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | that's the situation that he finds himself in, he's a tough guy, he's been through it I have no doubt that he'll, a good figure for the Soviet Union. I think his intentions and his ideals are well intentioned. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | in the long-term, I just think that because of the basic needs that the people don't have, I think that, makes the problem most severe, and makes him what his ideals are, personally. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | I agree. What's bad for the Soviet system is that they have the resources to grow and produce their food, somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | and, one thing, and then all the corruption. I think there's the have and the have-nots. |
|   A    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | Yeah That's probably more true than, a lot of people realize. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | I know you're going to have that with every society. At least we're more blatant about it, it's very secret, it's been going on for years. you can't change things overnight. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |           abandoned            | if it gets to a point where people can't survive, there's revolution. that's |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | It seems to be headed in that direction too. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah big time major that's what happens when, the cork blows you can't handle it anymore. |

|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, I can go with that answer too The only yes I could go to is if a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to a nuclear exchange, I don't even see that occurring. |

|   B    |       statement-opinion        | I don't really feel that the Soviets really want to blow up the world. we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as nonfeeling machine type people, they're people just like us. |

|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | I have seen them age twenty in the time and with the expense and everything, if you had a good nursing home they needed some quality care, |

I don't know how much longer this can last at that point because he requires round the clock. He can't do anything without her. He doesn't know when to take his medicine it's really sad I have thought if something would happen to my mother for, my brother's are not interested in helping me I would have to move him down here. That way, I want to see the nursing home. If I have to put him into one. where I can go see it. I'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | why  yeah. I am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yes. some of them are limited care too where people can do, they have apartment styles, but that wouldn't work for him. I think he is beyond that. Where if you need help you can get it, basically people kind of have a small apartment doctor's are available if they need them. |

|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah. I, yeah, I think a lot of people who do it now. In Colorado it's interesting. I talked to my mother. They allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home. my mother could make it on that. What she probably would do is disburse the money to me I would send it back to her that's what would happen. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Uh-huh. I think that's what most people do. You just have to give everything away. |

|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | I can't imagine. I'm twenty-nine. |

|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | I also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise he's still living at home I don't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | I know.    |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | it's kind of, you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations, something will have to change as more and more of us get older. luckily, if we could be like your grandmother, I would love to live to a hundred and two if I were okay. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | It,   yeah. |

|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | that's the bad thing. I would hate to have lived so long. She lived by herself. My grandfather passed away before I was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety, ninety-one. |

------------------------------------
|   A    |      conventional-opening      | Hello Ann. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Hello Chuck. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | the other day, I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | I didn't think that was a new revelation. |
|   A    |             accept             | it's not too new. |
|   B    |          wh-question           | Right. what is the E P A recommending now? |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | they really didn't propose any solutions. the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | he had a lot of, facts to give and, things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down of news print. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | He was talking about, the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print they could sell it for a while. They were able to sell it for some amount per ton now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling, they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Right. that's a common problem though. that has happened in Dallas as well as New York I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house after a while I just quit taking the newspaper because I couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either, I suppose. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah. We're doing some here in Cash Valley, the community here. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | we've actually got a kind of a nice set up. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | We've got a couple of plants here that actually take, recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them. Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside. |
|   B    |          appreciation          | that's good. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | one of the real keys, it sounds like, to getting recycling for, paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Right. There has to be, a reuse for it. that's why they recycle. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | The one I think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that, the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers. everything from, waste baskets to carpet to the sticky slide rugs under the carpet I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days they're making clothes now that are recycled. Like the recycled plastic coke bottles and milk cartons and things like that. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government. One was environmental protection the other one was, I can't remember what, |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | the basic idea, it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill the solution that he came up with for plastics,  it was really quite amazing, he says, the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | really. Right. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling, there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity. his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | it's carbon that makes sense, a carbon fuel of some sort, |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah. it's more than even paper or something like that. what  + There is more energy in it per pound or  whatever. |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | what  about emissions? |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | he didn't deal with that. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Oh.        |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | He just said burn it. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Okay       |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that. it's not very practical   . |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | No. it's interesting. I bet that was a good day, at the conference then. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, real interesting. |
|   B    |        yes-no-question         | Did it change anything for you? |
|   A    |           abandoned            | not too much. I got a bit. Actually, |
------------------------------------
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | my feeling is that, it's really being used today, it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Right, I think I've seen some statistics that say that, it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Right because all the prison expenses, plus all the legal expenses. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent. for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly don't think the people that are committing the crimes that would be eligible, really care. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | that's, committing them mostly is, either crimes of passion or at the moment they think they're not going to get caught |
|   A    |        quoted material         | Right, it's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon, I'm invulnerable, I don't need to care about this. |
|   B    |        uninterpretable         | Yeah,      |
|   A    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | never going to get caught. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis, for example, someone like, Jeffrey Dahlmer, do you want, by putting him in prison for life, there is still a possibility that he will get out again. |
|   A    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | Yeah, one way or another. |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | Whereas if you kill him, there is not that possibility. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, and somehow redeem himself. |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | Yeah, I don't think he could ever redeem himself, in some cases, yes. |
|   A    |        quoted material         | so that, problem with capital punishment you run into is, what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent, There are cases where, twenty, thirty years after the fact of getting evidence, especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence, then, oops, I'm sorry, guess we killed the wrong guy. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah, it's, yeah, once you've made a decision that way, it's a little difficult to go back on it. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Right, you can apologize nicely, I think, the price, the philosophy of the way our legal system works. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | yeah, yeah, it's a-, the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is, based on the, person who is accused. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah, I think that, the way it's being used now, it's like you listen to Bush where are we going to impose d-, it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing in, Tsongas is also saying, make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | again, I don't thing these people care. /* typo - replace thing with think They risk their lives every day. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Yeah,      |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | the risk is almost not there. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, in Massachusetts, we're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | you look at it's affecting it in any way. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | I think it's mainly, people, they get the vengeance of it. |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | Yeah, it's also, I used to live in Georgia the big thing down there was, all right, we have capital punishment, if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed, it's very racially related and ethnically related, |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | yeah it's lot of blacks. Also a lot of young people. a sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what I've seen. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |
|   A    |             hedge              | the victims' families and things, they're always talking about, feeling justified or feeling, like they've gotten something out of it, my thought has been, once the guy has been imprisoned, if he goes to jail forever or whatever, if he gets killed, it shouldn't make any difference to the victim's family. The only thing that should really, obviously, if someone of mine who has close died, I'd probably feel differently, |

|   A    |       statement-opinion        | benefits were just amazing we had everything paid for, with the government, it's not, quite that nice a deal. it's okay. What we have to do is, we have to pay, about twenty percent of our costs it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing, the plans that are available to us, range from kind of mediocre to really sweet plan at this point. it could be better, that's for sure, |

|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | I, myself have moved around quite a bit within the company I haven't had to move my residence to do that. I still live in San Jose |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Wow, that's fabulous. |
|   B    |           abandoned            | Yeah it,   |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | that's interesting, |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | yeah?      |
|   A    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | I have a cousin whose husband works for Hewlett Packard up in the Massachusetts area. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Yeah. Uh-huh. |

|   A    |         open-question          | Steve, with the election year and whatnot coming up, do you think we ought to cut taxes, raise them, what do you think? |
|   B    |             hedge              | that's a really hard question. I do know that, politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths. I let's example, our friend, the President, right now, says no new taxes, we should and especially, if anything, be cutting taxes now because of the recession at the same time, the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases, I know the politicians, aren't straightforward. in terms of economics I'm not, it's hard to call. It really is. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Uh-huh. the  question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little. on investment. For instance, like Social Security tax or Soc-, that's tax we're paying money supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire, the money will be there for us. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | that's, yeah, I  really think that money's history |
|   B    |             accept             | Yes,       |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | that's nothing we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back. someone was telling me that I may be wrong, I believe that the cure for polio is already founded, and staff it with people, it's really tough to close it down they just haven't yet. |
|   B    |             hedge              | yeah, I'm not exactly sure, about polio in particular. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | I know we have a polio vaccine come will prevent somebody from getting polio I'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | that might be the difference. I don't know. the other thing that, I remember seeing on T V lately had to do with, |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | it's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically to very strong politicians. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Yeah,      |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | to the main budget proposals the poor President has to, either accept or reject the whole thing. Oh. |
|   A    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | it sounds like that we'd be able to save some money by, passing the line item veto. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | the President, uses it to get rid of, this kind of waste. On the other hand, it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | and just to get rid of the unimportant things. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment, there's always going to be a dispute as to, and necessity is. that that will help solve our problems, there definitely is a problem with, I forgot, there's a political term for this stuff, pork barrel or something. |
|   A    |           summarize            | Yeah. Pork barrel politics. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Pork barrel politics. there has to be some way to do it. I know state governors usually have line item vetos I lived in Massachusetts for a while when Dukakis vetoed certain things, there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, Massachusetts wasn't in that great shape financially. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | D-, at least at the end. |
|   A    |           abandoned            | Uh-huh. I don't know, I, |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, they were very good at first, they were in very good financials at first that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well. of course, the bottom fell out. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | it's tough. there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations. I guess you can raise taxes and then create job programs and whatnot you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and whatnot. |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | And spare the economy. Yeah, it definitely is. Even not for government, even just, for a small business. I know some, |
------------------------------------
|   A    |        yes-no-question         | I'm not sure how it is in Georgia, the crime rate really is not very high at the moment. for Atlanta? |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | Atlanta is kind of high. it's lower than it has been in the past. I guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off, usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, I, that's probably not true only for Atlanta, but for just about anywhere. |
|   B    |             other              | Yeah. what kind of crime problem do you usually run into? Any specifics ? |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | the least, of residences. What's more likely to occur is,  things of that nature. Very few, assaults, on the college campuses, there are, cases of, people getting for, getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners. mostly petty things and, nothing really too big. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Right, I guess here we run into that sometime, |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Right.     |
|   B    |     statement-non-opinion      | I guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins that type, not much home break ins. There are some, but not very high. as far as tellers and things like that, it's not extremely high either. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | There were one case where, this one guy, was taking women from the teller and, making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time, raping them all, that's kind of like a double assault there. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah, a strange case that happened, was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Really?    |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | It was a free standing machine |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it. |
|   B    |          appreciation          | wow.       |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | there's a crime for you. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, there's a crime. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | Yeah, I guess most of the things that happen around here are pretty, innocuous. Although, from what I hear in the news, |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | saw an episode of the T V show, COPS one time that was in Pittsburgh, and things like that, it's not all that common. |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | okay. I don't know, crime situations here, they, like I say, and break ins and things like that a lot of it is due to drugs. |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | drug related, in most cases, it's not like, it's someone do steal a or television or V C R or something like that it is for drugs, because you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se, |
|   A    |          acknowledge           | Yeah.      |
|   B    |       statement-opinion        | you going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it you really not making a sizeable profit. it's not really lucrative to take chances like that, even though it does exist. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | I live in an apartment. Right now I'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh the apartment would be very easy for just about anyone to break in |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Right. Yeah. |
|   A    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | even so, to lock the doors when they go out and things like that. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh. Uh-huh. |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just, sit out back, take a look at when people are here and when they're not just come in, there's a T V and a V C R |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | and especially, since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open, while they're upstairs playing music, it could still happen then. |
|   B    |           abandoned            | Yeah, that's true, you'd be surprised also how, much people watch you that even not, participating in any type crime. I guess there was one case, I was surprised, so happened this person worked at the same place, I work for Georgia Tech they work at the same place I did, I didn't know that they had been watching me I was getting ready to go in my car one morning the first thing they said is, you must don't have to be to work at eight, like shock, |

|   B    |        yes-no-question         | I, get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED on national public radio. that is one of my big sources for current events information. I really like that coverage. My wife, on the other hand is home most of the day she watches a lot of the cable news network. have you, ever heard of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED? |
|   A    | statement expanding y/n answer | No, we don't have the, national public radio in my area. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | I can hear it at the college town nearby when I'm in Stillwater, which is about an hour away, the F M signal doesn't reach this far. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | I'll listen to shortwave quite a bit. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | It gives you a whole different perspective on the news, when you hear it from, a European point of view, or from the country of origin. I agree with you, too, on the cable channel, C N N and HEADLINE NEWS. |
|   B    |                                | Uh-huh. I'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper |
|   A    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | which is why I rely on shortwave cable, C N N. |
|   B    |         open-question          | I'm, interested in the shortwave aspect of it. how do you find that the coverage from other places in the world compares with the American coverage of, how do you think that, the viewpoints differ? |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | I think a lot of it is just, the fact that in the U S you're so far removed, in a lot of cases from, conflicts |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | than what's on shortwave. is  almost, |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it it just, they seem to give more of just the facts than opinions. |
|   B    |        yes-no-question         | Do you think, then, that, the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts? |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | very much so, very much so, I think a lot of it is, especially T V news, they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to really decipher the news and to really explain it. I think it's important to interpret it, a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to do the interpreting. |
|   B    |          or-question           | Uh-huh. the interpretive approach or the straight reporting? |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | I like the straight reporting. I hope to be able to form my own opinion of it. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | for thirty minutes for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard. a lot of time I don't hear exactly what they write into it. |
|   B    |          acknowledge           | Uh-huh.    |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | overall, I think I would rather hear just straight reporting. |
|   B    |   segment (multi-utterance)    | One of the things that I found interesting last year during the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against, Peter Arnett, who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting, some of the things that were available. hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory, while he was being severely, censored and could not make any judgment call on this, it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda, people were really down on him for reporting the fact that, this isn't a baby milk factory, how could he say it was, not just the facts, but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them. |
|   A    |       statement-opinion        | Yeah, people have that opinion. and find out every-, |

|   B    |        yes-no-question         | let's talk about the, wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order after the fact, the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it. What do you think? Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there? |
|   A    |     statement-non-opinion      | I don't think they're out of line. Devil's advocate possibly, you are trying to avoid paying taxes you're still circumventing it. You are legal in your circumvention of that law. |
|   B    |          wh-question           | what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though? what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying, income tax on something that you purchase mail order? |
